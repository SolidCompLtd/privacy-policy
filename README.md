# Privacy Policy for [Reality Twin]

Effective date: [10 08, 2025]

This Privacy Policy describes how [SolidComp Oy] ("we", "our", or "us") handles information collected by the [Reality Twin] mobile application ("the App").

## 1. Overview

The App is a digital twin application that allows users to create and share augmented reality (AR) content, including photos and videos. The App may access the device camera and local storage to enable AR experiences and content creation features.

## 2. Information Collection and Use

- **Camera Access:** The App may use the deviceâ€™s camera for AR visualization and to capture photos or videos.  
- **User-Generated Content:** Users can upload photos and videos to the App for sharing with other users. These files are stored securely in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage.  
- **No Third-Party Sharing:** We do not sell, share, or otherwise disclose user data to third parties.  
- **Data Retention:** Uploaded content remains in the cloud until the user deletes it. When a user deletes data within the App, it is also removed from our cloud storage.

## 3. Data Security

We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. All data transfers between the App and our servers are encrypted using secure protocols (HTTPS).

## 4. User Rights and Controls

Users can:
- Revoke camera permissions at any time through Android settings.  
- Delete uploaded content within the App, which will permanently remove it from our servers.  

We do not maintain personal accounts or store any personally identifiable information unless explicitly provided by the user.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed toward children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
